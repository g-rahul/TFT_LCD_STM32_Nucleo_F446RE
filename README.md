**Please Note:** the library code within this repository is not developed by me, this is a PORT from Controllerstech's STM32F103 (Bluepill) Code (https://controllerstech.com/interface-tft-display-with-stm32/) and mcufriendâ€™s arduino code, which can be found [HERE](https://github.com/prenticedavid/MCUFRIEND_kbv). I merely made some changes, so that it can be used with Nucleo 64 F446RE Board without complex library modification.

## Overview
For more information on how to modify and edit the tft library used here, please refer https://controllerstech.com/interface-tft-display-with-stm32/ article and mcufriend's repository https://github.com/prenticedavid/MCUFRIEND_kbv.

## Set up
Just Clone this project and use STM32-Cube IDE and CubeMX to debug and modify the system configuartion. Beginners can directly upload this code to STM32-F446RE-Nucleo64 Board to and verify the test display set up already built into the "main.c" file.
